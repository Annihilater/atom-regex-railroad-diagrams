# regex-railroad-diagram package

A regular expression railroad diagram view for regular expression 
under cursor.  This is still in development and for me it is a test of
graphics capabilities of Atom.

It also shows you a parsing error message, if your regex is not syntactically
correct.

For now it only supports most common regex features, but there are more 
to come.
